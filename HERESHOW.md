# Eviction Fighter How-To For Lawyers

It's easy to contribute your state to the Eviction Fighter conversation. If you build it, we can plug it in.

1. Design your conversation using simple y/n and multiple choice questions to tackle the common eviction-related questions for your jurisdiction.
2. Create it in code at the [QnAMarkup site](https://www.qnamarkup.org/). The chat on the right will teach you how it works. There's also a [Video Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVhzQ1JVi3s&feature=youtu.be) and a [Syntax guide](https://www.qnamarkup.org/syntax/).
3. Download the markup file: Click the "Save Markup to File" button below the conversation on the left.
4. Send the file to the Eviction Fighter team.

And that's it!
